Minecrust
=========

A game that intended to be a Minecraft clone in Rust. This is mainly a learning experience in
writing a game engine/voxel engine. As such, I’m striving to write as much of the voxel engine
stuff from scratch as possible. It’s in its super early stages right now, but I plan to keep
chipping away at it on the weekends and after work for as long as I can remain motivated about
it.

Here's a screenshot of it in its current state:
